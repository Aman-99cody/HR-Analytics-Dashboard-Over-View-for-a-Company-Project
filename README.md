📊 HR Analytics Dashboard – Power BI
Understanding Employee Attrition Through Data

This project focuses on analyzing HR data to uncover the main reasons behind employee attrition. The goal was to build an interactive Power BI dashboard that helps HR teams take informed decisions related to hiring, retention, and employee experience.

1. Project Overview

Employee turnover affects productivity, hiring costs, and overall team stability. Using HR data, I explored various aspects such as age, salary, job roles, satisfaction levels, and education fields to understand what drives attrition. The final dashboard provides a clear picture of these trends and helps highlight areas that need attention.

2. Data Analysis Life Cycle
Business Understanding
-I started by identifying the key questions that HR teams usually care about:
-Which age groups are leaving the most?
-Are salary levels related to attrition?
-Do certain job roles have higher turnover?
-How do satisfaction scores influence employee decisions?
-What patterns can we find based on tenure?

3. Data Collection

The dataset used was an HR employee attrition CSV file. I brought it into Power BI Desktop to begin the transformation and modeling process.

4. Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)

Here are the main steps I carried out during cleaning and preparation:

-Removed null entries and unnecessary fields
-Corrected data types for numeric, text, and date columns
-Created new calculated fields such as Age Groups and Salary Slabs
-Standardized categorical fields for consistency
-Handled missing values logically
-Built a structured data model with relationships for smooth filtering

These steps ensured that the data was clean and reliable for analysis.

5. Building the Dashboard

I designed the dashboard with a clean, modern layout, using a dark gradient background for better visual focus.
The report includes KPIs like:

-Total Employees
-Attrition Count
-Attrition Rate
-Average Age
-Average Salary
-Average Years at Company

I used different visuals such as donut charts, bar charts, column charts, and area charts to show trends clearly.

Key sections in the dashboard:

-Attrition by Education Field
-Attrition by Age Group
-Attrition by Job Role
-Attrition by Salary Slab
-Attrition by Gender
-Attrition by Years at Company
-Attrition by Job Role Satisfaction Score
-Attrition based on OverTime status

6. Key Insights from the Dashboard
1. Age Group Trends

Employees aged 26–35 had the highest attrition (116 employees), indicating mid-career movement or job switching for better opportunities and growth.

2. Education Field

Life Sciences (38%) and Medical (27%) showed the highest attrition, possibly due to market demand or better opportunities.

3. Job Roles

Roles such as:

-Laboratory Technician (62)
-Sales Executive (57)
-Research Scientist (47)
showed significantly higher attrition, possibly because numerous opportunities available in other organisations regarding these fields.

4. Salary Influence

Most employees leaving the organization were in the ≤5k salary slab (163 employees) which lesser than the average salary, showing a strong link between low pay and turnover.

5. Satisfaction Scores

Roles with lower satisfaction scores especially in Sales and Laboratory roles showed more attrition.

6. Tenure

Attrition was highest in the first year (59 exits), suggesting early stage engagement or onboarding issues.

7. Gender

Male employees had slightly higher attrition (150 compared to 87) suggesting women seeking more stability in the job roles.
